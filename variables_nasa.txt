Temperature at 2 Meters = T2M:
The average air (dry bulb) temperature at 2 meters above the surface of the earth.

Relative Humidity at 2 Meters = RH2M:
The ratio of vapor pressure to the saturation vapor pressure with respect to a plane surface of pure water, expressed in percent.

Total Column Precipitable Water = TQV:
The total atmospheric water vapor contained in a vertical column of unit cross-sectional area extending from the surface to the top of the atmosphere, sourced from the GMAO.

All Sky Surface Shortwave Downward Irradiance = ALLSKY_SFC_SW_DWN:
The total solar irradiance incident (direct plus diffuse) on a horizontal plane at the surface of the earth under all sky conditions. An alternative term for the total solar irradiance is the "Global Horizontal Irradiance" or GHI.

Precipitation Corrected = PRECTOTCORR:
The average MERRA-2 bias corrected total precipitation at the surface of the earth.

Cloud Amount = CLOUD_AMT:
The average percent of cloud amount during the temporal period.

Wind Speed at 2 Meters = WS2M:
The average of wind speed at 2 meters above the surface of the earth.
Wind speed is provided from an average of a large area and may not represent a point location due to surface properties, elevation changes, and local weather phenomena.

Profile Soil Moisture = GWETPROF:
The amount of water and water vapor present in the soil. Profile indicates the layer from the surface down to the bedrock. Values range from 0 for completely dry conditions to 1 for completely saturated soil.

Snow Precipitation = PRECSNO:
The snow precipitation at the surface of the earth.

Northward Wind at 50 Meters = V50M:
The estimate of the northward wind average speed for winds blowing 50 meters above the surface of the earth.
The northward wind component is provided from an average of a large area and may not represent a point location due to surface properties, elevation changes, and local weather phenomena.

Earth Skin Temperature Adjusted = TS_ADJ: 
The adjusted average temperature at the earth's surface. Adjusted refers to CERES source parameter.

VPD = (1 - RH2M/100) * 0.6108 * exp((17.27 * T2M) / (T2M + 237.3))
VPD (Déficit de presión de vapor) -> VPD alto = estrés hídrico, VPD bajo + alta humedad = roya
